 * For my Wacky Calculator I have decided to create a simple Discount Calculator. Truthfully my other two Functional Calculators took a lot out of me in regards to creativity. I would say my Industry Calculator could also moonlight as my wacky calculator in terms of true complexity for a beginner. I digress. The Discount calculator will obtain from the user the initial price of an item and how much the discount is. From that information a function will take place to calculate the total discount as well as provide the final price after discount including tax
