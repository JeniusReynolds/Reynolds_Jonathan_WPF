 * For my Industry function assignment I decided to do an Accruals calculator that will calculate how many accrual hours the user can expect to receive per year based upon an accrual calculator. Once that information is obtained it will also calculate what the value of those hours are based upon the employee's dollar per hour. The Accrual policy will be tiered on 3 levels continegent on how many years the employee has been with the company. The program wil obtain the user's tenure information and then make the appropriate calculations after.
