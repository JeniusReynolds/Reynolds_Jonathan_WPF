 * Industry Calculator
 * May 15, 2014
 *
 *For My Industry calculator I decided to create a Wage Calculator. I chose this idea becuase I currently work for a Payroll and Software company.
 *The calculator will do the following things:
 *1. Obtain The User's Annual Salary
 *2. It will Then Calculate The User's Pay Per Hour based upon a 40 Hour Work Week.
 *3. It will also provide the Users Gross Monthly, Weekly, Semi-Monthly, and BiWeekly Salary
 *4. As a way to increase complexity I will add an additional prompt at the end to allow the user to see what the results would be if they were to recieve
 *a merrit increase.
